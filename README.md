# Database Manager - Final Project for Database Subject
**You can find the [Spanish version of this README](README.ES.md).** 🌎

This project was collaboratively developed as the final assignment for the Database subject in our Software Engineering degree at the Telematics Faculty, University of Colima.

### Project Specifications 📄
We were assigned to create a Database Manager that initially allowed:
- Connecting to local users and databases.
- Performing SELECT queries.
- Displaying query results.
- Creating, modifying, and deleting records (CRUD operations) through dynamic forms.

The application also needed to:
- Validate the basic syntax of queries.
- **Disallow absolute commands (e.g., DROP DATABASE)**.
- Process only one query at a time.

### Key Learnings 👓👏🏼
- Basic understanding of GET and POST methods to fetch API data using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`.
- Deeper knowledge of React with TypeScript: components, hooks, context, design, requests, etc.
- Basic experience with Node.js and command-line usage.
- Improved understanding of version control systems (GitHub).

### Personal Reflections
This project challenged all my skills. I had never worked with React and TypeScript together before, and we had a very tight deadline—just under two weeks—with a large project full of strict requirements from our instructor.

Personally, there were moments of frustration. I had to do a lot of research as I was unfamiliar with much of what was required. There were obstacles and workflow blocks due to lack of knowledge, and we had to solve many problems as a team using what we already knew in order to save time.

Despite all the challenges, through teamwork and perseverance, we successfully delivered a functional prototype. It gave us a sense of pride knowing that we overcame so many obstacles to complete the project on time.

Beyond the technical knowledge I gained for my development as a future Software Engineer, I’m also proud to know that even when a project seems beyond my current capabilities, I have what it takes to overcome it: persistence, patience, and curiosity.

#### How to Run the Project Locally 🧑‍💻
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open it in your favorite IDE.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm i` (optional duplicate step).
5. Run `npm start`.
> *Note: Ensure the backend service is also running by cloning and setting up the backend repository using the same steps.*
